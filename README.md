# Predicting_MS_admission
Based on GRE score, GPA and Rank of a student, let's predict whether a student will get admitted or rejected using machine learning

Step 1 - Import all the necessary libraries using Pandas <br>
Step 2 - Visualize the dataset using Seaborn & Matplotlib <br>
Step 3 - Use cross validation techniques to split the dataset into "train" & "test" <br>
Step 4 - Try out different models and see which one is more apt. For this dataset, we'll use LDA, LR, KNN, CART, NB, RF, SVM <br>
Step 5 - Based on the scores, choose the best algorithm. Now train this model on the training dataset.<br>
Step 6 - Obtain the classification report and confusion matrix to determine precision, recalls.<br>
Step 7 - Provide new dataframe and try to predict using the model you made<br>

And that's it! You have your very own Machine Learning model that can predict admissions for MS.
